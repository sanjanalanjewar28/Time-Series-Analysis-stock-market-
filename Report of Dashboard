Stock Market Trend Analysis & Forecasting – Power BI Report

Project Overview
This project aims to Analyze and Forecast Stock Market Trends using Time Series Analysis techniques. The dashboard was created in Power BI and focuses on identifying historical patterns, understanding market seasonality, and making short-term and long-term predictions. The project offers a hands-on experience in financial data analytics, model development, and real-world interpretation of stock trends.



Project Objectives
* Analyze historical stock data to observe patterns over time
* Detect seasonal behaviors in stock prices
* Forecast future stock prices using built-in Power BI tools
* Visualize price movements and trading volumes
* Generate actionable insights for decision-making

Power BI Visualizations and Key Insights**

* Helps understand the long-term performance of the stock.

3. Forecasted Close Price (Next 30 Days)
* Built-in forecast feature in Power BI used to estimate future prices.
* Visualized using a line chart with forecast overlay.
* Supports short-term investment planning.

4. Average Close by Month Name
* Visualizes seasonality using monthly aggregation.
* Identifies months with consistently higher or lower average prices.
